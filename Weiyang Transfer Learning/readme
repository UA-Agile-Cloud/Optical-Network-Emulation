This folder contains python codes for the project 'Neural Network based quality of transmission prediction'. Should you have questions, please contact Weiyang Mo: wmo@optics.arizona.edu

Note1: All codes are running under Python 2.7. There might be some compability issues under Python 3

Note2: You may notice for classifier and regressor, the file name may end up with _sklearn or _keras. At the starting of the project, I use sklearn because it is simple to implement. However it does not support fine-tuning/transfer learning. So I jump to Keras. If you want to know about transfer learning, please only take a look at BER_classifier_keras and BER_regressor_keras

Note3: Dependencies are required to run these python files. Please install sklearn, keras, and tensorflow.


BER_classifier_keras: Use keras to build a neural network to do Q-factor classification.

BER_regressor_keras: Use keras to build a nerual network regressor to predict Q-factor
ParseData_BER: Parse the data from txt file.

Datacollection: Contains several files to automate data collection and channel power configuration.
